TODO-list for movida
======================
<nick>  == reported by
-->nick == assigned to


SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

<blue_death>	Add advanced filter and allow filtering from plugins (i.e. the import plugin!)


MID-TERM:

<blue_death>	Fix column width in the tree view and clean up the header and the context 
		menu some how
<blue_death>	Design and implement import plugin script options!!
		(command line par returns xml with config?)
<blue_death>	Multiple movie editing
<blue_death>	Use Qt 4.4 webkit! (wait until it's ready?)
<blue_death>	Integrate Qt Undo Framework


LONG-TERM:
<blue_death>	Artwork
<blue_death>	Metadata extraction from AVI and DVD


DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT (stuff that was rejected):

<ariya>		Add a CoverFlow view [reason: movie covers are usually too small or low res]
<cyril>		Browse local movies and extract info in realtime [reason: this is not what movida is about]
<blue_death>	5 star rating doesnt look fine. maybe 10 stars? [reason: keep things simple and clean - most software sucks because they fail at this point - IMHO]
