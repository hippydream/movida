*** Title: How to add new attributes to a movie.

This document is for developers who intend to modify movida and not for plugin
authors.

Adding new movie attributes requires the following changes to be done:
 - add the attribute with appropriate get/set methods to MvdMovie
 - add appropriate code to MvdCollectionSaver and MvdCollectionLoader
 - add both the attribute and the xml load/save code to MvdMovieData

 - add the appropriate code to one of the movie editor dialog pages (setMovieImpl, storeMovie,
   and update of the modified status)
 - add the appropriate code to the collection model and to Movida::movieAttributes(AttributeFilter)
