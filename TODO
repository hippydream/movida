TODO-list for movida
======================
<nick>  == reported by
-->nick == assigned to


SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

<blue_death>	Add multiple movie editing support to single movie editor
<blue_death>	"Drop here" message on filter bar should be moved to the info bar
<blue_death>	Add a "OR combine" checkbox to the filter widget (IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?)
<blue_death>	Import: context menu to open IMDb page in the results tree
<blue_death>	Import: preview browser view needs to handle urls (so we can open the IMDb page from here as well)
<blue_death>	Alternative titles (must be searched by default by the quick filter)
<blue_death>	Setting movie poster via D&D in smart view causes a crash
<blue_death>	Poster D&D from editor is buggy - won't accept drags (also need to implement web import!)

MID-TERM:

<blue_death>	Embed movie editor in main window
<blue_death>	Movie tree view must be editable
<blue_death>	Consider adding "open IMDb page" to context menu or toolbar
<blue_death>	Fix column width in the tree view and clean up the header and the context 
		menu some how
<blue_death>	Design and implement import plugin script options!!
		(command line par returns xml with config?)
<blue_death>	Make application instance unique and handle multiple collections?


LONG-TERM:
<blue_death>	Artwork
<blue_death>	Metadata extraction from AVI and DVD?
<blue_death>	Integrate Qt Undo Framework (won't be easy)


DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT (stuff that was rejected):

Add a CoverFlow view [reason: movie covers are usually too small or low res]
Browse local movies and extract info in realtime [reason: this is not what movida is about]
5 star rating doesnt look fine. maybe 10 stars? [reason: keep things simple and clean - most software sucks because they fail at this point - IMHO]
