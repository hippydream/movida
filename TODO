======================
<nick>  == reported by
-->nick == assigned to


SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

<blue_death>	Merge production and release year
<blue_death>	Add multiple movie editing support to single movie editor
<blue_death>	"Drop here" message on filter bar should be moved to the info bar
<blue_death>	Add a "OR combine" checkbox to the filter widget (IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?)
<blue_death>	Fix MvdClearEdit clear button with some styles
<blue_death>	Clearing the current filter should make the view scroll to the first selected item

MID-TERM:

<blue_death>	Consider adding "open IMDb page" to context menu or toolbar
<blue_death>	Fix column width in the tree view and clean up the header and the context 
		menu some how
<blue_death>	Design and implement import plugin script options!!
		(command line par returns xml with config?)
<blue_death>	Make application instance unique and handle multiple collections?


LONG-TERM:
<blue_death>	Artwork
<blue_death>	Metadata extraction from AVI and DVD?
<blue_death>	Integrate Qt Undo Framework (won't be easy)


DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT (stuff that was rejected):

<ariya>		Add a CoverFlow view [reason: movie covers are usually too small or low res]
<cyril>		Browse local movies and extract info in realtime [reason: this is not what movida is about]
<blue_death>	5 star rating doesnt look fine. maybe 10 stars? [reason: keep things simple and clean - most software sucks because they fail at this point - IMHO]
