A mmc file is a PKZIP 2.0 compatible zip file containing the
following files in a directory called "movida-collection":

metadata.xml (required)
Contains metadata information, like the number of movies stored
in the collection and some information about the owner of the 
collection (i.e. name, email or website).

collection.xml (required)
Contains the movies stored in the collection. Shared data items
like persons, genres or urls are not explicitly contained in the
collection. A numeric identifier refers to another xml file 
of the collection instead.

shared.xml (optional)
Shared data items are stored in this file, each in his own category
(like persons, genres, countries, etc.).
Every item has an identifier that has been used in the collection.xml
file.

collection.md5 (optional)
This file is currently unused and it might be removed before the final
release of Movida. Its purpose is to store the MD5 checksum of the xml
files. The file is quite useless as corrupt files won't be extracted
from the zip archive.

Please refer to the supplied DTD files in the "mmc_sample" directory
for details on the XML format of each file.
