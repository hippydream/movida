Managing your movie collection has never been so easy. And fun.

You don’t remember where you stored a movie?
Are you looking for other movies with that great actor?
Need someone to suggest you a short and funny movie you haven’t seen yet?

Well… ask movida!

The website is unfortunately out of date and there's still lots of work to do on the project, so please stand by.
